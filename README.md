# Wine-Quality - MLP

# WINE QUALITY – MLP (MULTI-LAYER PERCEPTRON)

● For this project, I had to create a Multi-Layer Perceptron instance using PyTorch and determine its performance using a dataset that contained information about wine

● Implemented and evaluated a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model using PyTorch

● Analyzed the Wine Quality dataset to predict wine quality based on various features

● Optimized the model's performance through hyperparameter tuning and regularization techniques

● Built a custom MLP class from scratch using Python to understand the underlying concepts

● Utilized training, validation, and testing splits to ensure robust evaluation
